# Monopoly

This was a project specifically designed for my Fall 2022 Algorithms class at Cal State Fullerton.

The main goal for this project was to simply design all of the playable features within the game
of monopoly onto the terminal.

Within the game itself, you can have anywhere from 2 to 6 players, and each player can do the
following:
1. Buy properties
2. Mortgage and unmortgage properties
3. Buy and sell houses for properties
4. Trade (Currently unavailable)
5. View their current properties and the amount of money they have

Players can also pick up chance and community chest cards, they can go to jail, and they can land
on income and luxury tax

When a player goes into debt, they can mortgage properties and sell their houses in order to
try to stay in the game. If they can not fully pay off their debt, then the player goes
bankrupt and they are out of the game.

The game ends once all players except one go bankrupt (last one standing), or if the program
is terminated by the user by closing the file (or through ctrl+c on the terminal)
